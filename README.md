## Description
In this project, we would analyze the six-months log file extracted from the SLURM controller. We defined 6 performance metrics (4+2 additional) and extracted the required information from
the log file. We display the data in table and graph form by using JavaFX. We have also built a user interface for easier visualization of the specified metrics
using GUI.
